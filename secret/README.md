#Please note the following
- This is not what ripple uses
- No help is provided getting this to work (If you do not know how to use it or get it to work then this is not for you)

#Rundown of what this is for those who does not get the joke
This is an automated anticheat (more or less).

For those who knows a little bit about how osu works you should already know that osu sends the process list and other stuff to the server.

This is not something unique about ripple, this is just how the game is made and we could chose to use it how official uses it or ignore it and will have to manualy go thru and check users. You will most likely never be checked unless you get marked by the automated process check.

So this boils down to; do we check your process to find interesting things like websites you got open etc.

The answer to that is no. We can not care less for what anime you watch and has no interests in going thru massive amount of data for no reason (surprisingly we do not want to go out of our way to catch hackers, but if we dont have a system for it then you know what will happen).

##If you are a server opperator:
Feel free to use this, but as mentioned above; No help will be provided. (You can still ask how stuff works if unsure but not related to setting this up)
##If you are a bystander:
This does not effect you in any way, but if you are interested in any of this feel free to do some research, it is very fun ;)
##If you are a cheater:
If you read this and did not know about this then you are not qualified as a hacker, then you are a skriptkiddy. This means you just download other people's stuff and use it without ever learning anything and have no idea how any of the stuff you run works. I hope you realise that you are cheating to get your name on a leaderboard... there is like no satisfaction from this and I do not get why people get something out of this. You do not even effect anyone by cheating since the only interaction in osu with others is to have your name in a list which will very quickly be removed.
